RDV is a visualization environment for scientific and engineering data. Built on
top of the RBNB dynamic data server, it supports local and remote data sources
and can visualize numeric, video, image, and audio data in a number of different
ways. RDV can be extended to support new types of data or visualize data in new
ways. RDV is free software and can be used without restriction according to the
conditions of the license. 

To install, unzip the distribution and launch the application by executing the
following: 

java -jar rdv.jar

To obtain a list of startup options use the following command:

java -jar rdv.jar -?

Note that it is recommended to increase the amount of memory that may be allocated
to the java heap by supplying the -Xmx option to the JVM.  At least 768MB of memory
is recommended when visualizing large data sets as in the following example:

java -Xmx768m -jar rdv.jar
