RDV Release Notes

RDV is a visualization environment for scientific and engineering data. Built on
top of the RBNB dynamic data server, it supports local and remote data sources
and can visualize numeric, video, image, and audio data in a number of different
ways.

number of other improvements have also been added in addition to a few bug fixes.

NEW FEATURES
- Tabbed main panel to support multiple docking areas for data panels
- Filmstrip mode for video/photo data panel stacks images to use more of the data
  panel area

  from still cameras
- Krypton Viewer Data Panel added to support visualization of 3D data from Krypton
  optical measurement systems
- Save/restore setup from RBNB server
- Disable local channel mode to lower memory consumption when graphing large 
  quantities of data
- Browsing and direct import of data files from NEEShub

IMPROVEMENTS
- Enhanced monitoring and playback performance to accommodate high data rates
- Charts can now override the global time range
- XY charts may now contain multiple plots using the same channel
- Increased support for large datasets

CHANGES
- Drop data feature now only applies to Image viewer and Tabular data panel 
  visualizations
- Added dedicated pause button

BUG FIXES
- XY chart corruption when playback rate is high
- Chart jitter when data sources are not time-synchronized
- Dial gauge panel no longer draws as an ellipse

Version 2.1.0
=============
This release contains support for the importing and exporting of files (both
RDV-related and otherwise) from NEESCentral. Users can login to NEESCentral from
RDV and supply a NEESCentral file path or URL to import data to their local
computer. Users can also export files from their local computer to NEESCentral in
similar fashion.

This release also updates Lehigh University's 3D-Modeling Viewer for RDV and
incorporates it into the standard NEES RDV product. 3D-Modeling support is now
available for MacOSX, Windows, and Linux platforms. Java3D libraries must be
installed to take advantage of the 3D-Modeling Viewer. More information can be
found at: https://www.nees.org/it/software/rdv/.

NEW FEATURES
 - NEESCentral File Import/Export: access data managed in NEESCentral repository.
 - Lehigh 3D-Modeling Viewer: 3D Model responds to channel-data in real-time.

IMPROVEMENTS
 - New Import implementation works with new NEESCentral Web Services.
 - New Export implementation completes bi-directional data access to NEESCentral.
 - Users may cut and paste file paths or URLS from NEESCentral.

CHANGES
 - Users will now be shown a login dialog only when NEESCentral features are
   selected. Login information is cached until expiration or an error occurs.

Version 2.0.0
=============
This release contains a new Spectrum Analyzer panel that can be used to visualize
data in the frequency domain. Also included is the new Virtual Channels feature;
this feature allows 'local' channels to be created in RDV which are functions of
one or more standard channels.

NEW FEATURES
 - Spectrum Analyzer: A panel that can display the FFT and PSD of a channel. [17]
 - Virtual Channels: 'local' channels can be created that are functions of other
   channels. [18]
 
IMPROVEMENTS
 - File dialog's will now remember the directory they previously were browsing.
   [40]
 - Added an option to specify the time on the command line. [32]

BUG FIXES
 - Fixed an error that occurred when importing JPEG's contained in a zip file
   with certain filenames. [37]
 - Offline mode will no longer trigger Windows firewall protection. [44]
 - Fixed an issue where OpenSees data files were imported with incorrect
   timestamp's and channel names. [46] 

CHANGES
 - The local time zone will be assumed if none is specified when importing data
   or JPEG files. GMT was previously assumed. [36]
 - Drop data is now disabled by default and should only be enabled if needed.
   [39]
 - The ability to import data from NEEScentral has been disabled. [38]

Version 1.9.0
=============
This release contains significant new features for viewing images and video, a
new dial visualization, and support for exporting MATLAB files. A number of
smaller improvements for plotting have been added in addition to a few bug
fixes.

NEW FEATURES
  - Support for zooming and panning of an image. A clickable navigation image
    can be used to jump around parts of an image when zoomed in. [2]
  - Filmstrip interface to view images sequentially. [3]
  - Support for viewing a thumbnail of an image to conserve bandwidth. [3]
  - DialViz, a visualization extension to view a numeric data channel on a dial.
    [22]
  - Export of data to the MATLAB MAT-file format. [23]

BUG FIXES
  - Can't connect to RBNB server with circular references. [4]
  - Children of shortcut servers aren't shown in channel list. [5]
  - Auto adjusting the domain axis in a time series plot does not work
    correctly. [16]

CHANGES
  - Plots set to auto range, don't always include zero anymore. [25]
  - The system look & feel is used now, so RDV should look more native to the
    platform it is running on. [27]
  - All RDV class were moved to the "org.rdv" package. [26]
